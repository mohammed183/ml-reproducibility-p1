    "Warm starting and cold starting are two different ways of initializing the weights of a neural network before training. <b>Cold starting</b> means starting with random weights, while <b>warm starting</b> means starting with weights copied from a previously trained model. In our context the model is previously trained on a subset of the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating datasets over time can be a costly endeavor, making it impractical to retrain models from scratch each time. Therefore, warm-starting becomes crucial as it allows leveraging pre-trained weights on a subset of the data, significantly reducing the time and resources required for training. By utilizing warm-starting, models can be efficiently adapted to incorporate new data without incurring the high computational expenses associated with starting from scratch."
