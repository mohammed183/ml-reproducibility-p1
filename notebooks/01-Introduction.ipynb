    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper *‚ÄúOn Warm-Starting Neural Network Training‚Äù* by Jordan T. Ash and Ryan P. Adams addresses a common challenge in machine learning scenarios where the neural network model needs to be updated with new data that comes in continuously. For instance, Netflix‚Äôs movie recommendation system has to continuously update its model to account for the ratings and views of users, as well as the features and genres of movies, which change over time as new movies are released or existing movies are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper investigates the trade-offs between two retraining strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Starting from scratch with random weight initialization\n",
    "-   Using the weights of the model trained on the dataset before the new data was added\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are your thoughts on each of these initializtions?** ü§î"

    "Training a new model from scratch using the old and new data, ignoring the existing model weights and biases is called **Cold-starting** ‚ùÑÔ∏è. Training a new model using the old and new data, but initializing the model weights and biases from the existing model is called **Warm-starting** üî•. In the following notebooks We will evaluate the author‚Äôs claims and verify them with experiments to answer the previous question.\n",

    "-   üë®‚Äçüíª develop the skills to critically analyze specific claims, both qualitative and quantitative, that are made in the research paper\n",
    "-   üß™ learn to identify the specific experiments they would need to run to validate each claim\n",
    "-   üßê learn to identify the data, code, and hyperparameters that are necessary to run each experiment, and to make reasonable choices when these are not provided\n",
    "-   üí∏ understand the computational cost associated with reproducing a result, and the impact of missing information on that cost."
