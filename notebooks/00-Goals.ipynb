    "\n",
    "-   develop the skills to critically analyze specific claims, both qualitative and quantitative, that are made in the research paper\n",
    "-   learn to identify the specific experiments they would need to run to validate each claim\n",
    "-   learn to identify the data, code, and hyperparameters that are necessary to run each experiment, and to make reasonable choices when these are not provided\n",
    "-   understand the computational cost associated with reproducing a result, and the impact of missing information on that cost."

    "-   Is the code written by the authors themselves, or by someone else? Are there multiple implementations available for comparison?\n",

    "-   Did the authors compare their model to other models that are not implemented in the code? Are these models available elsewhere?\n",
    "-   Are all the hyperparameters for all the experiments clearly specified? If not, how sensitive is each hyperparameter to the performance?\n",
    "-   Were the initial values set randomly or deterministically?\n",
    "-   Are the datasets used by the authors accessible? Are there any preprocessing steps or modifications done to the data?\n",
